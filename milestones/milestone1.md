## Abstract

100-200 words explaining the general idea for your project.  Be sure to read the project requirements and consider how you'll incorporate the various components.  These details can change as much as needed over the next few weeks, but we want to take a look at what's being considered.

## Preliminary Data Sources

For each source please add a section with the following:

### Data Source #1: {Name}
US population Cesus
- A URL to the data source.
- Is the data coming from a webpage, bulk data, or an API?
Census API
Education Bulk data
Crime API

- Are there any challenges or uncertainity about the data at this point?

School Location and the dissagregation level we can get from the census data

## Preliminary Project Plan

A short summary of what components of the project might be needed (e.g. data ingestion, cleaning/preparation, visualization).
You might also begin to think about who will work on what.

Cesus data management: Angela 
School data: Shahzaib
Crime data: Cesar

This can be very brief, and will almost certainly change by the next milestone.

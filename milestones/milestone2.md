## Abstract

Early school dropout is a multifaceted challenge that impacts education systems and societal outcomes in both developed and developing countries. In the United States, this phenomenon varies notably across and within regions. For instance, Chicago public schools display a wide range of 9th-grade dropout rates, ranging from 0% to 56.6% (CDPS, 2024). While the influence of individual, family, and school characteristics is well documented, a growing body of studies has begun to explore the effects of broader social contexts on adolescent educational outcomes such as neighboorhood context crime or violence. This project aims to integrate, analyze, and visualize spatial, administrative, and demographic data to characterize school dropouts across Chicago schools, with a particular focus on the role of crime in shaping these educational outcomes. 

## Data Sources

### Data Reconciliation Plan

An important thing to do at this step is to have a plan for how data from your various sources will be brought together. to discuss on Thursday

For each data set, you will need to identify the "unique key" that will allow you to connect it to other data sets. (We'll discuss this in more detail.)

Additionally, for each data source, add a section like:

### Data Source #1: {Name}

### Data Source #1: { US Population Census - American Community Survey }

- URL to the data source: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/census-microdata-api.html
- Is the data coming from a webpage, bulk data, or an API?: Census API
- How many records (rows) does your data set have?
- How many properties (columns) does your data set have?
- Write a few sentences about your exploration of the data set. At this point you should have downloaded some of the data and explored it with an eye for things that might cause issues for your project.
- Are there any challenges or uncertainity about the data at this point?: Yes, the microdata geography is the public use for certain areas we havent fully mapped Chicago.

### Data Source #2: {Chicago Crime Data}
- URL to the data source: https://www.chicagopolice.org/statistics-data/data-requests/
- Is the data coming from a webpage, bulk data, or an API?: Chicago Police Depertment API

- How many properties (columns) does your data set have?
- Write a few sentences about your exploration of the data set. At this point you should have downloaded some of the data and explored it with an eye for things that might cause issues for your project.
- Are there any challenges or uncertainity about the data at this point?: None we have thougth of at this point

### Data Source #3: {Chicago Public Schools Administrative Records}
- URL to the data source: https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/ 
- Is the data coming from a webpage, bulk data, or an API?: Administrative Records - Bulk data
- How many records (rows) does your data set have?
- How many properties (columns) does your data set have?
- Write a few sentences about your exploration of the data set. At this point you should have downloaded some of the data and explored it with an eye for things that might cause issues for your project.
- Are there any challenges or uncertainity about the data at this point?: How to Map Schools (Locations)


## Project Plan

Please provide a project plan that will help keep your team on track. (thursday)

It is recommended that you:

- Identify required (and optional) components of the project to be built.
- Have a plan that makes it clear what will be built by Milestone #3 (it may be helpful to break this out weekly for the remainder of the quarter) and what will be built by the final project.
- For each component, identify who is primarily responsible, and who else might work on it with them.
